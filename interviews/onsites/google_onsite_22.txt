#behavioral 

- good, generic questions
- describe conflict and how you solved


#1 - 

a. single mountain array ex. 123432321 -> binary search 
b. multiple peaks mountain also using binary search
-> find the local mins, and separate arrays and pass into (a) 
-> trick is how to use binary search when array isn't sorted since multiple slopes


#2 - possible coordinate mapping

→ list of strings such as “P1 (S | W | NE ... SE | N | E) P2”
→ see if these coordinate arrangement is possible  
→ build graph, detect cycle 
→ if cycle then 


#3 - server aggregation 

- server aggregated time
- you have tuples for each server that has RAM usage "changes"
	S1 = [(0,0), (3,10), ... ]
	S2 = [(0,0), (3,10), ... ]
- result array should contain 


#4 possible square

- given list of points in 2d-plane and query point, see if it’s possible to build square
- create set for all points
- also create vertical and horizontal lookup mappings for each x and y 
- only check for points in same vertical/horizontal plane
