Given an array S of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in S such that a + b + c = 0?

For example, given array S = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4],
A solution set is:
[
  [-1, 0, 1],
  [-1, -1, 2]

### FROG JUMP - TIKTOK ###
##########################
'''
A frog is crossing a river. 
The river is divided into x units and at each unit there may or may not exist a stone. 
The frog can jump on a stone, but it must not jump into the water.

Given a list of stones' positions (in units) in sorted ascending order, 
determine if the frog is able to cross the river by landing on the last stone. 
Initially, the frog is on the first stone and assume the first jump must be 1 unit.

If the frog's last jump was k units, then its next jump must be either k - 1, k, or k + 1 units. 
Note that the frog can only jump in the forward direction.

Note:

The number of stones is ≥ 2 and is < 1,100.
Each stone's position will be a non-negative integer < 231.
The first stone's position is always 0.
Example 1:

[0,1,3,5,6,8,12,17]

There are a total of 8 stones.
The first stone at the 0th unit, second stone at the 1st unit,
third stone at the 3rd unit, and so on...
The last stone at the 17th unit.

Return true. The frog can jump to the last stone by jumping 
1 unit to the 2nd stone, then 2 units to the 3rd stone, then 
2 units to the 4th stone, then 3 units to the 6th stone, 
4 units to the 7th stone, and 5 units to the 8th stone.

The geometric information of each building is represented by a triplet of integers [Li, Ri, Hi],

### STOCK PROFIT I ###
######################
'''
Suppose we could access yesterday's Apple stock prices as a list, where:
The indices are the time in minutes past trade opening time, which was 9:30am local time.

Pad extra spaces ' ' when necessary so that each line has exactly maxWidth characters.

Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. 
If the number of spaces on a line do not divide evenly between words, 
the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.

For the last line of text, it should be left justified and no extra space is inserted between words.
